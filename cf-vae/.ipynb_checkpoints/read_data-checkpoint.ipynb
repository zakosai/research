       "'Silverpot Tea, Pure Darjeeling, is an exquisite tea enjoyed at leisure, when you want to relax or celebrate.   Its mellow yet layered taste will constantly surprise and delight.  This subtle and refined tea is of incomparable taste and flavor.  \\n\\nPackaged in an exotic handmade pinewood chestlet, this magnificent tea was rolled from tender leaves grown and hand plucked in the legendary mist covered fields of Darjeeling.\\n\\nFor authentic experience of this luxury tea, it is presented as 100 gms  loose leaf, and is a great way to show your appreciation, celebrate an occasion or send your best wishes.\\n\\nSilverpot is different - it embraces the pioneering spirit of the Ghose family, personifies the highest standards of excellence, and is proof that this is only possible from the love and care of a family tea company located at the country of origin, with a tea tradition of five generations.The Silverpot philosophy is, first and foremost, about a passionatecommitment to quality and a series of uncompromising choices. These, taken together, create a taste anda style that is as legendary as it is unique. Silverpot Tea balances richness, freshness andfinesse, and is nurtured from the leaf to the cup with painstaking care and attention to detail.HERITAGE.Silverpot is born of a cherished heritage dating back to 1879, when tea was still a monopoly of the colonial rulers, and the Ghose family established Indias first native owned tea plantation. The legacy of Debes Chandra Ghose and his family continues till this day. Each expression of Silverpot draws on the companys long history, rich traditions and legendary dedication to quality teas.'"
